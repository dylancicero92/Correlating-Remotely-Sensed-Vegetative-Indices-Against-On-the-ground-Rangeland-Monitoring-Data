# Correlating Remotely Sensed Vegetative Indices Against On-the-ground Rangeland Monitoring Data

This study correlates remote sensing indices from Sentinel-2 data to on-the-ground forage biomass measurements for a 
ranch in southeastern Montana. Image processing was performed using the Google Earth Engine console and the 
Google Earth Engine Python API.
